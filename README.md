## Guide on how to use the helper function file:
HelperFunction.java contains cleaned up versions of the functions to compute the adjacency matrix and
the list with the degrees for each node. This way our code can be kept cleaner.

To use the functions in HelperFunction.java you need to download it and put it in the same directory
with your program file. To call the functions you can just say "HelperFunctions HF = new HelperFunctions()"
in your main and then call the functions by saying HF.getAdjacencyMatrix() for example.
Documentation on the parameters and return values on these functions is provided in HelperFunctions.java, so
feel free to read it up there, or ask me (Sim) if you have any questions.


I will try to keep the HelperFunctions file up to date so that we can gradually build up our own set of instruments
that we can use and reuse when needed.
