## How to run our code
Please download this repository and navigate into the root folder of this project.
### 1. Tournament version

- To run the tournament version of our code just type in the command "java -jar Group09.jar %Graph_File%", where "%Graph_File%" needs to be substituted with the path to the graph file on which to run our program, and hit enter.

### 2. Report version

 - To run the report version of our code with verbose output, just type in "java -jar 09-CodeThirdPhase.jar %Graph_File%" and hit enter. (See above for substitution rules on "%Graph_File%"). 


# Note:
To inspect our code, navigate into the corresponding folder ("ReportCode" for the code run when executing "09-CodeThirdPhase.jar" and "TournamentCode" for the code to be used in our tournament version. The only difference between these two folders is the "ReadGraph.java" / "ReadGraphTournament.java" file, which has its only differences in what it prints in the terminal/cmd).
